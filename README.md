# 🌐 **CODOC**

✨ **Why Codoc? What does it mean?**  
We chose **Codoc** because we wanted a name that’s easy to remember **and** a palindrome (because who doesn’t love symmetry? 🤷‍♂️). The name **Codoc** was brilliantly suggested by [@Nmec](https://github.com/Nmec2).

The meaning of our name is a **double entendre**:

1️⃣ **Co-Op DOCumentation**: Collaboration is at the heart of what we do. We believe in teamwork and sharing knowledge to create something greater than the sum of its parts.

2️⃣ **CODe Original Content**: We’re all about creating unique, original, and innovative content that stands out in the web development world.

Both meanings perfectly describe our mission with this blog: **to collaborate, document, and create original content that inspires and educates**.
