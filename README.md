# CODOC 
Why Codoc ? What does it mean ?
We chose Codoc because we were searching for a name easy to remember, and also a palyndrome.
And the name Codoc came up, thanks to @Nmec.
The meaning of our name is a double entendre:

The first one being :
Co Op DOCumentation

the second:
CODe Original Content

And both of the names describe very well what our goal is with the blog, that's why I included
this little bit of story in this file.
